## Inspiration
Our inspiration stemmed from meeting a wide variety of individuals throughout this school year. We found that language barriers, hearing disabilities, and even being mute has prevented people from properly expressing themselves. However, with using Sona, we give the ability to such individuals to express themselves simply with some phrases or lyrics they deem important to them.

## What it does
This web application allows users of various backgrounds, whether they are deaf, mute, or unable to play musical instruments, to generate any type of music with ease. Users are able to keep their music for themselves, or share them with the public for everyone to enjoy! 

## How we built it
We built Sona with the Next.js web framework for server-side rendering. The frontend was developed using HTML, CSS, and Javascript/Typescript for components to have multiple interactive features within our web application. Utilizing various Generative AIs, such as Beatoven, Gemini AI, and Stability AI, we seamlessly created related pieces to generate song cards for users. Pinata was our primary backend, to store all of our images, audio files, and user information. 

## Challenges we ran into
With it being our first time utilizing multiple APIs, more notably Generative AI APIs in our project, we struggled with the hassle of rate limiting, and even the scenarios where we were unable to use certain models due to being paywalled. In addition, being faced with learning and implementing a new database such as Pinata, we had to go through trials and tribulations in order to use it efficiently in our web application, often struggling with how we were to format and structure our groups in order for our file storage to be as efficient as possible. The novelty of new technology definitely made us fight tooth and nail to complete our project. 

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We're very proud of getting our hands dirty into Generative AI, with most of us never utilizing Artificial Intelligence APIs before UGA Hacks X. Furthermore, we managed to integrate Pinata into our program, a modern approach to cloud storage, where we learned how easy it can get to store and manage files using their grouping feature.
## What we learned
While developing Sona, we gained a lot of experiencing utilizing new tech on the fly, whether it be a new framework, new databases, such as Pinata, or even embracing the new Generative AIs. Furthermore, as this was the first time this team was working together, we had to make sure that we worked efficiently, where we learned how to effectively split tasks in bite sized chunks in order to make smooth progress. 

## What's next for Sona
Looking more into the future, we would like to make sure our platform can expand to as much underprivileged people as possible, as well as making it a platform that everyone can enjoy. We hope to utilize even better Gen AIs to make the experience easier and seamless, so it could even be a revolutionary platform where people would flock to express themselves in ways they couldn't imagine before.
